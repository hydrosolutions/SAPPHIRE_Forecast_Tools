# Hydrological forecast with machine learning tools
This repository contains the code to generate hydrological forecasts using machine learning tools. There are 2 main components to this code:
1. Operational forecast: Performs a forecast for the last day operational river runoff data is available (from a pre-processing step)
2. Hind cast: Fills gaps in the operational forecast (for example if the server was temporarily unavailable down) so that forecast skill metrics can be calculated over the full period.
