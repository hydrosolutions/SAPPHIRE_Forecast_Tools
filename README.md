# SAPPHIRE_forecast_tools
Tools for operational hydrological forecasting for Central Asian hydromets. The tools are co-designed with the Kyrgyz Hydrometeorological Services as part of the ongoing [SAPPHIRE project](https://www.hydrosolutions.ch/projects/sapphire-central-asia) and funded by the [Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation](https://www.eda.admin.ch/eda/en/home/fdfa/organisation-fdfa/directorates-divisions/sdc.html).

The tools are designed to be deployed on a local computer with access to operational hydrometerological data and the [iEasyHydro](https://ieasyhydro.org) database. This repository holds data from the public domain for demonstration.

Note that this repository is **WORK IN PROGRESS**.

# Overview
3 tools are currently deployed via Docker and provided in this repository (see folder apps):
  - A dashboard to configure the forecast tools (currently only available in Russian language)
  - A tool to produce forecasts (in the present version linear regressions as currently employed by the Kyrgyz Hydrometeorological Services)
  - A dashboard to visualize and download the forecasts

## Folder structure
All software components are in the apps directory. A .env file holds file & folder addresses and access information to the iEasyHydro Database. Files that need to be reviewed and potentially edited or replaced for local deployment are highlighted with a #. They are discussed in more detail in the file doc/deployment.md.
Potentially sensitive data that needs to be provided by a hydromet (for example daily discharge data used for the development of the forecast models) is stored in the data folder. Here we provide publicly available data examples from Switzerland for demonstration.

   |__ apps
       The software components of the SAPPHIRE Forecast Tools.
        |__ backend
            The backend of the forecast tools. This is the component that produces the forecasts.
             |__ .dockerignore
                 Lists files and folders that are not copied to the docker image.
             |__ Dockerfile
                 Dockerfile to build the docker image for the forecast backend.
             |__ forecast_script.py

             |__ run_offline_mode.py
                 The python script that runs the forecast backend in offline mode. Used for testing and development and to produce hindcasts.
             |__ run_online_mode.py
                 The python script that runs the forecast backend in online mode. Used in deployment.
             |__ setup.py
                 Setup file for the forecast backend. Makes sure the backend finds the iEasyHydroForecast library.
        |__ config
            Configuration of the forecast tools. The content of the files needs to be adapted to deployment conditions.
#            |__ .env
                 Holds file and folder paths as well as access information to the iEasyHydro Database. This file is read by all forecast tools when deployed using Docker.
             |__ .env_develop
                 Same as .env but for local development. This file is read by all forecast tools when run locally as local folder structer differs from deployed folder structure.
#            |__ config_all_stations_library.json
                 Information about all stations that are potentially available for the forecasting tools. This includes station codes, names, and coordinates.
                 -> TODO: Need to describe how to write this list initially.
             |__ config_output.json
                 Defines what outputs are generated by the forecast tools. This file is written by the forecast configuration dashboard.
             |__ config_stations.json
                 A list of stations selected for the production of forecasts. This file is written by the forecast configuration dashboard.
        |__ configuration_dashboard
            A user interface to configure for which stations forecasts are produced and what outputs are generated. The dashboard is written in R and uses the Shiny framework.
             |__ www
                 Static files (icon Station.jpg) used by the dashboard.
             |__ dockerfile
