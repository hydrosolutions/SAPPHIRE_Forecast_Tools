# SAPPHIRE_forecast_tools
Tools for operational hydrological forecasting for Central Asian hydromets.

WORK IN PROGRESS

# Folder structure
The entire project is structured as follows: All software components are in the apps directory. A .env file holds file & folder addresses and access information to the iEasyHydro Database. Files that need to be reviewed and potentially edited or replaced for local deployment are highlighted with a #. They are discussed in more detail in the file doc/deployment.md.
Potentially sensitive data that is provided by a hydromet (for example daily discharge data used for the development of the forecast models) is stored in the data folder.

  SAPPHIRE_FORECAST_TOOLS
   |__ apps
        |__ config
            Configuration of the forecast tools. The content of the files needs to be adapted to deployment conditions.
#            |__ .env
                 Holds file and folder paths as well as access   information to the iEasyHydro Database.
             |__ config_all_stations_library.json
                 Information about all stations that are potentially available for the forecasting tools. This includes station codes, names, and coordinates.
                 -> TODO: Need to describe how to write this list initially.
             |__ config_output.json
                 Defines what outputs are generated by the forecast tools. This file is written by the forecast configuration dashboard.
             |__ config_stations.json
                 A list of stations selected for the production of forecasts. This file is written by the forecast configuration dashboard.
        |__ iEasyHydroForecast
            A collection of python functions that are used by the linear regression tool.
#  |__ data
       Example data to demonstrate how the forecast tools work. The Needs to be replaced with data by the hydromet organization for deployment.
   |__ doc
        |__ deployment.md
            Deployment instructions
